## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Floating Chatbot Access (Priority: P1)

As a user reading educational content, I want to access a chatbot from any page to ask questions about the material. The chatbot appears as a floating bubble in the bottom-right corner that I can click to open a conversation interface.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational feature that enables all other chatbot functionality. Users need a consistent way to access help and information across the entire educational platform.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking the floating bubble and verifying the chat interface opens, allowing users to send messages to the backend API and receive responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing any page on the educational platform, **When** I click the floating chat bubble in the bottom-right corner, **Then** a chat interface appears with a message input field and conversation history display
2. **Given** I have opened the chat interface, **When** I type a message and submit it, **Then** the message is sent to the backend API and the response is displayed in the conversation

### User Story 2 - Text Selection Context Capture (Priority: P2)

As a user reading educational content, I want to select text on the page and have it automatically captured as context when I use the chatbot, so I can ask specific questions about the selected content.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the user experience by allowing contextual questions without manual copying and pasting, making the learning process more efficient.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting text on any page and verifying that when the chat interface is opened, the selected text is available as context for the conversation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have selected text on a page, **When** I click the chat bubble or type in the chat input, **Then** the selected text is automatically included as context for my query
2. **Given** I have selected text and opened the chat interface, **When** I submit a question related to the selected text, **Then** the chatbot responds with answers that reference the selected content

### User Story 3 - Chapter-Specific Personalization and Translation (Priority: P3)

As a logged-in user reading a chapter, I want to use dedicated buttons in the chapter header to personalize content for my learning style and translate to Urdu, enhancing my learning experience.

**Why this priority**: This provides personalized learning capabilities that differentiate the platform and improve learning outcomes for individual users with different preferences and language needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, navigating to a chapter, and verifying that the personalization and translation buttons appear and function as expected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in and viewing a chapter page, **When** I click the "Personalize for Me" button, **Then** the chapter content is modified to match my learning preferences and history
2. **Given** I am logged in and viewing a chapter page, **When** I click the "اردو میں ترجمہ" button, **Then** the chapter content is translated to Urdu while maintaining readability and formatting
3. **Given** I am logged in and viewing a chapter page, **When** I view the progress circle, **Then** it shows my completion status for the current chapter

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user selects very large amounts of text (e.g., an entire chapter)?
- How does the system handle multiple text selections without clearing the previous selection?
- What occurs when the chat API is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system behave when a user is not logged in but tries to use personalization features?
- What happens when the translation service fails or returns an error?
- How does the system handle very long conversations that might impact performance?
