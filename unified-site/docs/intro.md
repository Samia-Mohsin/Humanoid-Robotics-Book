# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Course Overview

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** educational platform. This course focuses on AI systems in the physical world with embodied intelligence, bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students will apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

### Focus and Theme
- **AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.**
- Goal: Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body
- Students apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments

### Quarter Overview
The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into four main modules:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
2. Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
3. Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
4. Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
5. Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
6. Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

## Weekly Breakdown

The course spans 13 weeks with the following structure:

- **Weeks 1-2**: Introduction to Physical AI
- **Weeks 3-5**: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- **Weeks 6-7**: Robot Simulation with Gazebo
- **Weeks 8-10**: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
- **Weeks 11-12**: Humanoid Robot Development
- **Week 13**: Conversational Robotics
