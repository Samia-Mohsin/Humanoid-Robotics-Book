# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

## Project Overview

The Autonomous Humanoid capstone project represents the culmination of your learning journey in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This comprehensive project integrates all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course modules to create a simulated humanoid robot that can receive voice commands, plan and navigate paths, identify and manipulate objects using computer vision, and operate autonomously in dynamic environments.

### Project Goals

The primary goals of this capstone project are to:

- **Integrate All Modules**: Combine the knowledge from ROS 2, Simulation, AI Brain, and VLA systems into a cohesive application
- **Demonstrate Conversational Robotics**: Implement systems using GPT models for natural interaction
- **Execute Complete Perception-Action Pipeline**: Create a full pipeline from sensing to action
- **Showcase Embodied Intelligence**: Demonstrate AI in physical space through humanoid robot behaviors

### Project Phases

The capstone project is structured in multiple phases that build upon each other:

1. **Phase 1: Robot Design** - Design and configure the humanoid robot in simulation with proper URDF models and sensor configurations
2. **Phase 2: Locomotion** - Implement bipedal walking, balance control, and navigation capabilities
3. **Phase 3: Perception** - Develop computer vision, VSLAM, and sensor fusion for environmental awareness
4. **Phase 4: Action and Interaction** - Integrate voice recognition, cognitive planning, and manipulation capabilities

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this capstone project, you will be able to:

- Synthesize knowledge from all course modules into a functional system
- Implement a complete robotic system with multiple integrated components
- Demonstrate embodied AI in action through autonomous behaviors
- Practice interdisciplinary engineering by combining various technologies

### Assessment Criteria

Your project will be assessed based on:

- Successful integration of all subsystems
- Reliable voice command recognition and execution
- Effective navigation and obstacle avoidance
- Quality of object identification and manipulation
- Professional presentation of project results and lessons learned

This capstone project challenges you to apply theoretical knowledge to practical implementation, providing hands-on experience with the complexities of humanoid robotics in real-world scenarios.
