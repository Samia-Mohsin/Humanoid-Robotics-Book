# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Focus
The convergence of LLMs and Robotics.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement Voice-to-Action using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
- Use cognitive planning with LLMs to translate natural language ("Clean the room") into a sequence of ROS 2 actions
- Master the convergence of LLMs and Robotics
- Complete the capstone project: The Autonomous Humanoid

## Topics Covered
- Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
- Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language into ROS 2 actions
- The convergence of LLMs and Robotics
- Multi-modal interaction: speech, gesture, vision
- Conversational robotics with GPT models
- Speech recognition and natural language understanding

## Weekly Schedule
Week 13: Conversational Robotics
- Integrating GPT models for conversational AI in robots
- Speech recognition and natural language understanding
- Multi-modal interaction: speech, gesture, vision

## Prerequisites
- Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Module 2: Simulation
- Module 3: AI Brain

## Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid
A final project where a simulated robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object using computer vision, and manipulates it.
